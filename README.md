# BitBlasterBot

This project demonstrates how to create a bot for the game BitBlaster XL in both python and C#. These bots use process memory introspection, so long as the game window is open the program can access the information that it needs for the reward shaping that it uses. I had a bit of trouble with the python varient, it lacks the performance to be used i do have some ideas on how to improve that. The C# version needs 2 computers to work, one to play the game and one to run the unity project.
